<h2>Chicken adobo on the table.</h2>

<p>My Filipino mom taught me how to make tangy, savory chicken adobo, passing on to me the recipe her mother taught her. So naturally I thought hers was the one true way. Then I found out that everyone makes it a little differently, and everyone swears theirs is authentic. So now that I'm teaching my son how to make it, I'm curious to know who's right. Turns out we all are.</p>
<p>The dictionary defines adobo as "a spicy dish or sauce." In the Philippines, adobo refers to a centuries-old process of preserving food by stewing it in vinegar and salt. It was Spanish colonialists in the 16th and 17th century who gave the native dish its current name, and Chinese traders who introduced soy sauce to replace the salt. To this day, all Filipino adobo recipes have vinegar in common, but the other ingredients depend on region, town, and even family. Garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, and other spices might go into the mix, and even the type of vinegar can vary.</p>
